# Code-Exercises
These are code exercises I did while learning Javascript. Most are my solutions to freeCodeCamp exercises, challenges in the book <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Eloquent Javascript</span>, or homework assignments from my various online classes (Stanford Algorithms class and Udacity Full-Stack Javascript Developer class for example).

NOTE: The Caesarian-cypher, cash register, and React controlled form programs are still being debugged. Full test suites will soon be published for each program in this repo as well.
