# Code-Exercises
This is a collection of small-scale programs I've made in the past year or two while learning Javascript/Typescript. Most are my solutions to freeCodeCamp exercises, challenges in the book <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Eloquent Javascript</span>, Khan Academy exercises, or homework assignments from my various online classes (Udacity Full-Stack Javascript Developer class for example).

NOTE: Hello, please note that files in the "developing" directory (and currently a few in the "tests", "algorithms" and "data structures" directories) are still under development and in need of further testing/debugging. I update this whole repo regularly, so check back again later, and these files (from the "developing" directory) will probably make their way into the "src" directory. Thanks. -Nick
